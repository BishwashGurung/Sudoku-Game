# Sudoku Solver with GUI
This Sudoku Solver is a Python program using the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Pygame, allowing users to play Sudoku interactively and watch the solver in action.

## Gameplay
- Use the mouse to select a cell.
- Use the keyboard to input numbers (1-9) for the selected cell.
- Press SPACE to let the solver attempt to solve the puzzle.
- If the puzzle is solvable, the solver will fill in the cells. If not, it will indicate that the puzzle is unsolvable.

## How it Works
- The Sudoku solver employs the backtracking algorithm, a brute-force algorithm that tries all possible solutions until it finds the correct one.
- The GUI is created using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- Users can interact with the Sudoku grid using the mouse to select cells and the keyboard to input numbers.
